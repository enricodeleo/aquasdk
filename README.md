# **AquaSDK**

**A modern JavaScript SDK generator from OpenAPI specs**

<img src="logo.jpg" alt="aquasdk logo" width="200"/>

AquaSDK is an open-source tool that generates a fully-featured JavaScript SDK from an OpenAPI specification. It enables easy integration with APIs through a chainable, **Waterline-like** syntax. AquaSDK helps you rapidly create SDKs, making it easier to interact with RESTful APIs.

### **Why**

**Waterline ORM**, commonly used in [Sails.js](https://sailsjs.com/), is often praised for its intuitive and flexible syntax, which simplifies database interactions.

---

> **‚ö†Ô∏è Note on Upcoming v2.0.0 Release**
>
> We are excited to announce that version 2.0.0 is underway! This major update will introduce significant improvements, including a more robust and intuitive Waterline-style query builder.
>
> Please be aware that **v2.0.0 will include breaking changes**. The new query builder is designed to be more powerful and flexible, but it will require updates to your existing code. We believe the long-term benefits will be well worth the one-time migration effort.

## üì¶ **Installation**

You can easily install AquaSDK globally, or locally for development.

### Global Installation
Install AquaSDK globally for command-line access:
```bash
npm install -g aquasdk
```

### Local Installation (for development)
To install locally and contribute to the project:
```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/enricodeleo/aquasdk.git
cd aquasdk
npm install
npm link
```

---

## üõ† **Usage**

Once installed, you can use the `generate-sdk` command to generate a JavaScript SDK from an OpenAPI specification.

```bash
generate-sdk <swagger-file-path> <output-directory> <version> [--verbose]
```

### Arguments

- `swagger-file-path`: Path to your OpenAPI/Swagger JSON file (default: `./swagger.json`)
- `output-directory`: Directory where the SDK will be generated (default: `./sdk`)
- `version`: The version number of the generated SDK (default: `1.0.0`)
- `--verbose`: Flag for detailed logging

### Example

```bash
generate-sdk ./swagger.json ./sdk 1.0.0 --verbose
```

## üéâ **Features of the Generated SDK**

The generated SDK includes the following features:

- **Waterline-like Syntax**: Chainable query methods for interacting with your API, similar to Sails.js/Waterline. Brings ORM-style chaining (`.find()`, `.limit()`, `.sort()`) to REST API calls, making client-side code more expressive.
- **Thenable Queries**: Await queries directly without needing an `.execute()` call, leading to cleaner, more intuitive code.
- **OpenAPI-Driven Development**: Automates SDK generation from specs, reducing human error and ensuring alignment with API contracts.
- **Promise-based API**: All API calls return promises, making them compatible with `async/await`.
- **Response Headers Access**: All API responses include both data and headers, allowing access to important HTTP header information.
- **Support for Associations**: Handling relationships via `.populate()` mirrors Waterline's eager-loading, a standout feature for nested resources.
- **Configurable HTTP Client**: Support for additional Axios configuration options to customize timeout, headers, and other HTTP client settings.

## üíª **SDK API Example**

Once the SDK is generated, you can use it as follows:

### Example Code
```javascript
import API from './sdk/index.js';
import { operators } from './sdk/utils/queryUtils.js';

// Initialize the SDK
const api = new API({
  baseUrl: 'https://api.example.com',
  auth: {
    token: 'your-auth-token'
    // Or use basic auth
    // username: 'user',
    // password: 'pass'
  },
  // Additional Axios configuration options
  timeout: 5000,
  headers: {
    'Custom-Header': 'value'
  },
});

// Examples using the new Waterline-style syntax
async function examples() {
  // Find all users (queries are now "thenable")
  const usersResponse = await api.users.find();
  const users = usersResponse.data;
  const headers = usersResponse.headers;

  // Find a single user by ID and select specific fields
  const user = await api.users.findOne(123).select(['name', 'email']);

  // Find active users, populate their company, and sort by creation date
  const activeUsers = await api.users
    .find({ active: true })
    .populate('company')
    .sort('createdAt DESC');

  // Advanced query with pagination and field selection
  const paginatedAdmins = await api.users
    .find({ role: 'admin' })
    .limit(10)
    .skip(20)
    .select(['name', 'lastLogin']);

  // Create a new user
  const newUser = await api.users.create({
    name: 'John Doe',
    email: 'john@example.com'
  });
  
  // Access response headers (e.g., for rate limiting info)
  console.log('Rate limit remaining:', newUser.headers['x-rate-limit-remaining']);

  // Update an existing user
  const updatedUser = await api.users.update(123, { name: 'Jane Doe' });

  // Delete a user
  await api.users.destroy(123);

  // Use complex criteria with operators for more powerful queries
  const recentSignups = await api.users.find({
    createdAt: operators.greaterThan(new Date('2024-01-01')),
    status: operators.notIn(['archived', 'deleted'])
  });
}
```

## üîç **How It Works**

### 1. **Reads the OpenAPI spec**
AquaSDK parses your Swagger/OpenAPI JSON definition to understand your API's structure.

### 2. **Preprocesses the spec**
The tool resolves circular references and prepares the API definition for SDK generation.

### 3. **Generates Model Classes**
A class is created for each model in the OpenAPI schema, ensuring proper data handling and validation.

### 4. **Builds Method Chains**
AquaSDK generates a Waterline-like query syntax for accessing your API‚Äôs resources.

### 5. **Creates the SDK**
A complete SDK is generated, including methods, models, and utility files.
